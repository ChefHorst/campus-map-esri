# WWU Campus Map using ESRI's JS SDK #

## Building a production version of the website ##

For this project, I am using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a development environment. Vite is a combonation tool that includes a develepment server and a build profile. 

For package management I am using [NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Both of these tools are required.
